                    <h1>Include our SDK</h1>
                    <p>To start tracking with the Mixpanel <b>JavaScript</b> library, you'll paste our <a href="https://mixpanel.com/help/reference/javascript">initialization code</a> into all the pages in your side of inside the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/head&gt;</code></code> tags.</p>

                    <p>To start tracking client-side with <b>Android</b> or <b>iOS</b> libraries, see our brief tutorials on installing client-side SDKs documentation for <a href="https://mixpanel.com/help/reference/ios#installing">iOS</a> and/or <a href="https://mixpanel.com/help/reference/android#quick-start">Android</a></p>

                    <p>If you're using server-side libraries, such as python, java, node, ruby, or HTTP (to name a few) we also have <a href="https://mixpanel.com/help/reference/python">implementation documentation</a> on these libraries.</p>
                    <p>Regardless of which library you choose, you will need to get your <b>mixpanel project token</b>. The token uniquely identifies your mixpanel project, and is critical to properly send Mixpanel event. Your projects token is located in the settings menu and can be accessed like this:</p>

                    </p>
                    <p><i>Note: it is a best practice to create a mixpanel project for <b>development</b> and one for <b>production</b>. The only difference between the two would be the token.</i></p>

                    <p>Mixpanel breaks down data silos by making analytics accessible to users of all types. Therefore, inviting your team to Mixpanel a critical step to moving towards data-driven decisions.</p>

                    <p>Membership controls are implemented on a per-project basis. To add people to your team, find the â€˜invite team members button in the bottom left corner of the screen, and add users by entering their email and pressing invite:</p>

<p><i>Note that users with an existing Mixpanel account will not get an email; they will simply be added to that project</i></p>

<p>Mixpanel projects you belong to are indicated in the top left drop-down of the application:</p>

                    <h1>Focus on your Goals</h1>
                    <p>Mixpanel is an <b>event</b>-driven analytics platform. Unlike other analytics tools, <b>You</b> will determine the actions (events) and details (properties) which are important inside your application. Describing data in the form of events and properties is what allows us to ask complex questions of data:</p>

                    <p><img class="still" src="stills/event-annotated.png" ></p>


<p><b>Events</b> are the primary actions that a user will take in your application... examples of events would be: logging in, adding a friend, leaving a comment, making a sandwich, adding an item to cart, making in-app purchase, checking out etc... Events are the <i>top level</i> object in mixpanel, and they will be the genesis for most of your analysis</p>

<p><b>Properties</b> are what <i>describe</i> those events and make them more meaningful. Properties are <i>essential</i> to every good mixpanel implementation. Examples of properties would be: User Type, $ in Cart, Page Name, # of times opened, or 'type of bread' if you like the example above.</p>

<p>Here's a pretty simple and straighforward visualization that may help you better understand the structure of events and properties in mixpanel:</p>

<p><img class="still" src="stills/imp-spec.png"></p>

<p>Because the relationsip of events and properties can be complex, we <b>highly</b> reccomend authoring a document which specifically details the events and properties in your application you'd like to track.</p>

<p>From our experience, a good implementation spec looks like this:</p>
